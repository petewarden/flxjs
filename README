 FlxJS
 http://github.com/petewarden/flxjs

 This is a collection of 2D geometry classes implementing the Flex3 interface, originally
 created to help me port OpenHeatMap from Flash to Javascript/HTML5.
 
 I tried to emulate the Adobe classes as closely as possible, so their documentation
 is the best place to start. Here are the links for the three classes I've implemented:
 http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/geom/Matrix.html
 http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/geom/Point.html
 http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/geom/Rectangle.html
 Not all of the functions are implemented, just the ones I needed for my code. If you do
 need to implement any of the missing ones, I'm happy to accept updates from github forks.
